# Web-Design-Challenge
This repo contains the files necessary for the data anlysis website. I decided to use my own data froma project rather than the data used in the API homework.

There are a total of 8 pages: home page (index.html), comparison (comparison.html), data (data.html), and a page for each plot:
Cases (cases.html), Deaths (deaths.html), Population (populaiton.html), Poverty (poverty.html), and Correlation (correlation.html)

There is also an assets folder that contains all the images used on the website. 

There are a few bugs in the website that I would fix if I had more time:
1) The dropdown menu plots doesnt work 
2) When in a small window the nav bar changes but the toggle button does not work
3) I need to add more analysis and text to the website. Right now I just have some short filler text.
